Version 1 - 6/9/2015 Dave

This initial version has no error handling. Any I/O errors just cause the python script to exit with an unhandled exception. 

Currently, the library is using the AdaFruit_BBIO library. To install it run:
  # opkg update && opkg install python-pip python-setuptools python-smbus
  # pip install Adafruit_BBIO
  
SMB is also required:
  # pip install smb
  
This version has only been tested with the i2c clock set to 400MHz. 

Setting i2c clock rate
  # backup the original .dtb
  cp /boot/am335x-boneblack.dtb /boot/am335x-boneblack.dtb.orig

  # generate the dts from the dtb
  dtc -I dtb -O dts -o am335x-boneblack.dts /boot/am335x-boneblack.dtb

  # modify the dts with a text editor

  # generate the dtb from the modified dts
  dtc -I dts -O dtb -o am335x-boneblack.dtb am335x-boneblack.dts
